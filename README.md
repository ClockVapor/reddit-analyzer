# reddit-analyzer
Analyzes reddit comments to run various statistics


## scraper
`scraper` is a command-line tool that fetches reddit comments and builds a JSON map of words to how many times each
word is seen, organized by subreddits.

### Usage
`-c CONFIG_FILE -d DATA_FILE -s SUBMISSION_LIMIT -C COMMENT_LIMIT -p TIME_PERIOD -m MODE SUBREDDITS_LIST...`

- **CONFIG_FILE**: YAML file read in by `scraper` that must contain the following information for the reddit API:
```yaml
appId: <reddit app id>
appVersion: <reddit app version>
clientId: <reddit app client id>
clientSecret: <reddit app client secret key>
username: <reddit username>
```
- **DATA_FILE**: JSON file that `scraper` will store its output in. If this file already contains output from a
previous `scraper` execution, it will be appended.
- **SUBMISSION_LIMIT**: Maximum number of reddit submissions to fetch.
- **COMMENT_LIMIT**: Maximum number of comments per submission to fetch.
- **TIME_PERIOD**: Time period from which to fetch reddit submissions. `{all, year, month, week, day, hour}`
- **MODE**: `scraper`'s execution mode. If omitted, `default` mode is used.
  - `default`: Words are counted normally, as many times as they appear.
  - `comment`: Each word is only counted once per comment (if a comment contains the same word multiple times, the word
  will only be counted once).
- **SUBREDDITS_LIST**: Space-separated list of subreddit names to fetch data from, not including the `/r/` or `r/`.


## analyzer
`analyzer` is a command-line tool that runs statistics on the JSON data output by `scraper` and creates another
JSON file that lists each subreddit's most distinguishing words, as compared to all other subreddits it analyzes.

### Usage
`-d DATA_FILE -o OUTPUT_FILE -l LIMIT -w WEIGHT_EXPONENT`

- **DATA_FILE**: JSON file generated by `scraper` to analyze.
- **OUTPUT_FILE**: JSON file to write results to. This file is overwritten.
- **LIMIT**: Maximum number of most distinguishing words to list for each subreddit.
- **WEIGHT_EXPONENT**: Exponent to use in the following formula to give each word its "score":

This exponent governs the trade-off between giving high scores to words that are unique to each subreddit, and giving
high scores to words that appear often in each subreddit. Values close to or less than 1 will place more weight on
words being unique to a subreddit, while values greater than 1 will place more weight on words being used often in a
subreddit. A value between 1 and 2 is a good balance that will give high scores to words that are both fairly
unique and used fairly often in each subreddit.

If `WEIGHT_EXPONENT = 1`, unique words will be given higher scores than words used frequently. If a subreddit has 500
occurrences of the word "the" out of 5000 occurrences across all subreddits, the first term of the score for "the" will
be `500/5000 = 0.1` (notice that the second term is constant for each subreddit). The same subreddit also has 20
occurrences of the word "foo" out of 30 occurrences across all subreddits, making the first term of its score
`20/30 = 0.66`. So, even though "the" is used more frequently than "foo", "foo" still gets a higher score because
it is more unique.

On the other hand, if `WEIGHT_EXPONENT = 2`, words used frequently will be given higher scores than unique words.
Using the same subreddit and words as above, the first term of the score for the word "the" would be
`(500^2)/5000 = 50`, and the first term of the score for the word "foo" would be `(20)^2/30 = 13.33`.
So, even though "foo" is more unique than "the", "the" gets a higher score because it is used more frequently.
